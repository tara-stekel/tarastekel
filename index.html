Hello üëã and welcome to my Cloud resume! The page you're on is written in HTML5/CSS3. Developed using a containerized application in a development environment, and deploying the application to the cloud. Managed by Amazon ECS cluster ran and maintained by task services. Hosted on an AWS VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) with NAT gateways, security groups, and an application load balancer. The domain name was registered in Route 53, Amazon's DNS service, and a record set was created to map the domain name to the ECS cluster, only utilizing the wide variety of Cloud services AWS has to offer. </p>
